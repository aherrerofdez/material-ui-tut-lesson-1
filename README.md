### Project for the course on Accessible Design and Assistive Products

Download the code and run in the downloaded folder path **```npm install```** to install dependencies before starting the app.

You'll also need to install Material UI as a dependency. To do this run:

``` npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled ```

``` npm install @mui/icons-material ```

``` npm install @material-ui/data-grid ```


Finally, run **```npm start```**

And the application should start on http://localhost:3000/
